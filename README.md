# Vector and Matrix Checker

This script is used to check whether a user input is a row vector, column vector, matrix, or augmented matrix. The script is written by Matin Huseynzade and Fakhri Jafarov.

# Usage

The functions in this script can be used to check whether a given input is a row vector, column vector, matrix, or augmented matrix. The following are the functions available in this script:

`row_vector(user_input)`
This function takes a string input and checks if it is a row vector. A row vector is defined as a vector enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas. The function returns True if the input is a row vector and False otherwise.


`column_vector(user_input)`
This function takes a string input and checks if it is a column vector. A column vector is defined as a vector enclosed in square brackets and separated by commas. The function returns True if the input is a column vector and False otherwise.


`matrix(input)`
This function takes a string input and checks if it is a matrix. A matrix is defined as a set of vectors enclosed in either parentheses or square brackets and separated by commas. The function returns True if the input is a matrix and False otherwise.


`augmented_matrix(input)`
This function takes a string input and checks if it is an augmented matrix. An augmented matrix is defined as a matrix with a vertical line separating the coefficients and the constants. The function returns True if the input is an augmented matrix and False otherwise.
